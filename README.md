# 👋 Hi, I'm Sefa  

I am a Junior Data Engineer with training in *Python, SQL, Azure, Fabric, and Power BI*.  
At the moment, I volunteer at *Humanitas Groningen* on a social project, which allows me to give back to the community while I continue improving my technical skills through practice and self-learning.  

💡 My goal is to grow into a role as a *Data Engineer* or *Data Analyst*, where I can apply what I have learned, keep developing myself, and contribute as a reliable team player.
